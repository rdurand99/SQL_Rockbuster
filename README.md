# SQL Rockbuster Project
This data analytics project was conducted in SQL for the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program.

## Objective
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. They are now looking to diversify by launching an online rental service in order to stay competitive with streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. 

The study aims to answer business questions in order to help with the launch strategy for the new online rental service. 

These questions are as follows: 
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
